# Contributing

Hey there, so you've decided to contribute back to this project, you're awesome!

Any contributions are welcome and will be revised, this is a safe space for you
to test your knowledge. If you think someone has mistreated you in some way becasue
of that, report the user to us inmediately and we'll take action.

We have a very simple set of rules:

First and foremost: BE EXCELLENT TO EACH OTHER.

* **No politics allowed of any kind**, this is software, it doesn't care about politics
* Any kind of mistreatment due to knowledge level, gender, culture, or background won't be tolerated
* Cultural differences are real - what seems obvious to you might not be to others
* Everyone here is learning. Ego and condescension have no place in this project
